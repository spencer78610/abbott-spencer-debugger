# Drag and Drop Puzzles

This site is used for puzzles using a drag and drop feature for the puzzle pieces there will be four diffferent puzzles available with different ways to solve them.

However we ran into some bug issues this is my debugger plan:

First there is a bug with the puzzle pieces being able to overlap each other. I will need to use java script to try and allow only one image to contain the dropzone.

The second bug is with pieces appearing in the drop zone when choosing a new puzzle. To fix this I plan to target the puzzle buttons and so when “clicked” they reset the puzzle pieces. 

For the third problem which is the puzzle pieces not switching pieces when you switch puzzles I plan to fix this bug the same way as bug 2 just instead of resetting they switch to the puzzle pieces that go with the puzzle.
